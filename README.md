## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- Nodejs (with/without Expressjs)
- MongoDB
- GraphQL  
- React Native  

### What I learned

- `React-Hot-Toast`: This library provides lightweight and customizable user notifications for React applications, making it easy to display informative messages to users.  
- `Zod`: Zod is a type schema validation library used in TypeScript or JavaScript. It helps ensure data integrity by defining the expected structure and format of data, preventing errors and improving code reliability.  
- `useFormState` and `useFormStatus` Hooks: These hooks manage the state and status of a form within React components. useFormState handles form data and submission, while useFormStatus provides information about the form's state (e.g., pending submission).  
- `DaisyUI` first practical use in project. DaisyUI being a popular CSS framework known for its pre-built components and utility classes, which can significantly accelerate web development.
